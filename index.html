<p>The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, or ENIAC, was built at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946. It was built by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert. Because of its electronic technology, as opposed to electromechanical technology, it was over 1,000 times faster than any other previous computer made. The ENIAC used panel-to-panel wiring and switches for programming, it occupied more than 1,000 square feet, and used about 18,000 vacuum tubes. It was also theorized that the ENIAC had done more calculation over the ten years it was in operation than all of humanity had done until that time. It was built during World War II by the United States. It was designed for the specific purpose of computing values for artillery range tables, it lacked some features that would have made it a more generally useful machine. The ENIAC had cost the government $400,000, and the war it was designed to help win was over. Its first task was doing calculations for the construction of a hydrogen bomb.

<p>The IBM-built in 1958 SAGE or Semi-Automatic Ground Environment was designed to detect Russian nuclear bombers. SAGE was the largest computer project in the world during the 1950s. It pioneered many technologies including a special-purpose form of networking. Besides networking SAGE also helps pioneer interactive computing and multi-user systems. These included magnetic-core memories, which worked faster and held more data than earlier technologies; a real-time operating system the first of its time. Hundreds of people used the system to simultaneously, interacting through groundbreaking graphical consoles. There were 23 computer centers across North America, communicating with radar stations, counter-attack aircraft, and each other, as potentially threatening events are happening. By the early 1960s, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) would make the bomber threat – and SAGE itself – partly or mostly obsolete. But the system would continue to operate until the 1980s.</p>


<center><h4>North America and the Rise of Online Services and BBSs</h4></center>

<p>Personal computers have started to slowly take off in North America by the end of the 1970s, a decade earlier than most other parts of the world. Connecting them to remote servers could be a nightmare of endless settings and false starts, also accompanied by the squawks and squeals of an expensive, finicky modem. In 1990 more than two million North Americans will be online for discussion groups, shopping, news, chat, e-mail, and much more. Most computer owners don't bother, but by 1979 a subset of brave or stubborn ones are subscribing to early online services like the online service MicroNet, the source, or bulletin board services. And those early online services had been joined by AOL, Prodigy, and other online services.</p>
